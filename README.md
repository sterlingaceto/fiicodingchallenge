# Fii Coding Challenge

## About this application

This website was built to showcase my abilities to learn Vue.js and use it to create a website. A url containing JSON data was given to parse and provide the images and context for those images.

This application uses HTML, CSS and javascript with the Vue.js framework.

## Procedure
While developing this application, version control using git repositories was carried out through the entire project.
Vue.js was taught through the Vue.js' manual and tutorials on the framework's website.

## Installation instructions

Once the project is downloaded simply launch the html document
with a browser that supports Javascript.
